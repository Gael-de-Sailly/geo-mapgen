# Geo Mapgen
Geo Mapgen is a (still experimental) mod for [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) that allows to generate map from digital elevation models like [SRTM](http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SELECTION/inputCoord.asp).

It is somewhat like [realterrain](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=12666) but behaves differently: you need to run a separate Python file that transform the image into a database that is directly readable by Minetest. This solution was made to avoid running Lua libraries with Minetest (which is not recommended) or reading directly the image with the Lua API that is not made for that.

## Usage
You must first convert the DEM image into a database, using the python script `image_convert.py` provided by this mod. You need a working Python installation, with libraries `numpy` and `imageio`.

This will generate 2 files in the world directory: `heightmap.dat` which is the database, and `heightmap.dat.conf`, configuration file working with the database.

Syntax for the Python script:
```
image_convert.py input_file.tif minetest_world_directory [options]
```
Note that even if TIFF files are the most commonly used, any image with only one color channel can be loaded by this script.

### Complete list of options:
- `-f [integer]`: Fragmentation. In the database, the image is cut into squares with a fixed size (by default 80 px) to make data searching faster.
- `-s [float]`: Vertical scale, number of meters per node (default is 40). Can also be adjusted in the configuration file `heightmap.dat.conf`.
- `-r [integer|filepath]`: Enable rivers. If integer, minimal surface for catchment area, to produce a river (usually some thousands). If filepath to an image, this image is read and river is set where value > 0.
- `-l [integer]` Controls the elevation (in meters) below which river are no more calculated. Default to -128.
- `-c [float]`: Coefficient describing the increase of river width (default to 0.25) when rivers join together. At 1, river width is proportional to its catchment area; at 0, rivers are all one block wide.
- `-d [integer]`: To avoid wide rives completely filling narrow gorges, limit the width of the river if the valley is deeper than this size (in meters, default is 40)

### Example of use:
```
./image_convert.py '/home/gael/dem/srtm_38_04.tif' '/home/gael/.minetest/worlds/bidule' -f 100 -s 90
```
If you use rivers, the calculation can take a long time (can be over 15 minutes). Please be patient, you can do something else during it's calculating.

Once the files are generated, you can start playing.
